editorial process updated june 30 2021 25 ratings add a comment jump to recipe pin share email elise bauer it's chile season my poblanos are taking over the garden right now so i thought i would cook up a few into a hearty corn chowder the soup consists of onions celery garlic yukon gold potatoes corn green poblano chiles and chicken stock near the end you swirl in cream (chiles love cream) to balance out the heat of the chiles and add a splash of lime juice for brightness it's like a green chile tamale in soup form so good green chiles are always better if you roast them first blackening them either over a grill on a gas stove or under a broiler to give them more flavor and to help remove the tough outer skin that said with this recipe you could easily use canned green chiles elise bauer save it print roasted poblano corn chowder prep time

to 8 servings this chowder comes alive when splashed with lime juice at the end don't omit that step but do wait until the end when you are serving the chowder you don't want to simmer a cream based soup with something acidic like lime juice it just might curdlethe amount of chiles you use depends on how hot they are and your tolerance to heat poblanos are considered a mild green chile like anaheims or mild hatch green chiles but sometimes you get a hot batch so make sure to taste the chiles for heat before putting them in the soup if they are too mild for your taste include some of the seed podalthough i've specified poblanos any mexican mild green chile will work with this soup ingredients 5 to 6 large poblano green chiles (to yield 1 1/2 cups roasted peeled and chopped) (can sub canned chopped green chiles enough to yield 1 to 1 1/2 cups the amount depends on how hot the chiles are) 3 tablespoons butter 2 medium onions diced (about 2 1/2 cups) 2 ribs celery diced (about 3/4 cup) 1 clove garlic minced (1 teaspoon) 2 medium yukon gold potatoes peeled cut into 1-inch chunks (10 to 12 ounces) 4 ears corn (enough to yield 4 cups corn kernels) or 4 cups corn 5 cups chicken stock (use vegetable stock for vegetarian option) 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 bay leaves 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 2 limes one sliced for garnish one for juice (can substitute lemon juice) method roast the chiles: there are lots of ways to do this (see how to roast green chiles over an open flame) i tend to just put them either directly on the flame or in one of those grill pans with holes in them over the gas flame you can roast them on a grill or under a broiler just make sure they get blackened all over then put them in a bowl cover the bowl and let them steam when they've cooled down enough to touch use your fingers or a dampened paper towel to strip off the charred bits cut them open remove and discard the stem seed pod and inside veins roughly chop the chiles and set aside elise bauer elise bauer soften the onions and celery: melt butter in a 5 to 6 quart heavy-bottomed pot on medium high heat once the butter is melted add the onions and the celery stir to coat with the butter cook for 8 to 10 minutes lowering the heat to medium until the onions and celery are softened and are beginning to brown elise bauer elise bauer prepare corn: while the onions are cooking if using fresh corn on the cob cut the fresh kernels of corn away from the cobs add potatoes stock spices: once the onions and celery are beginning to brown add the garlic and cook for a minute more add the potatoes and the stock to the pot add the bay leaves cumin oregano and salt increase heat and bring to a simmer lower heat to maintain a simmer and cook for 8-10 minutes until the potatoes are just cooked through elise bauer elise bauer add corn then poblanos: add the corn kernels to the pot and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until cooked through add the chopped roasted poblanos to the pot elise bauer elise bauer add cream: remove the bay leaves stir in the cream add black pepper more or less to taste at this point if you want a thicker base for your chowder you can use an immersion blender or standup blender to purée about a third of the soup elise bauer elise bauer to serve sprinkle with a little fresh lime juice and serve with a slice or two of lime nutrition facts (per serving) 294

editorial process updated march 09 2022 add a comment pin share email sabrina modelle jump to recipe 12 amazing ways to grill chicken this summer featured in: caesar salad is a classic crisp romaine rich and garlicky dressing crunchy croutons and the pungent tang of good parmesan—they come together to create a uniquely balanced salad this version adds a smoky element with the grilled chicken and the grilled garlic croutons sabrina modelle the ingredients for caesar salad this salad comes together quickly and easily with simple ingredients many of which you probably already have on hand i'm using boneless and skinless chicken thighs which stay juicier than chicken breasts and cook very quickly you can prepare the chicken ahead of time either by marinating it up to 24 hours in advance or by grilling the chicken up to two days before and serving it as a cold salad i use gluten-free sourdough to make my grilled croutons—which are basically slices of bread—but you can use any good crusty bread stale bread works great for croutons as it crisps up beautifully if yours is very fresh that’s fine too you’ll get a crispy exterior with a softer interior i typically serve this with 2 or 3 slices of grilled “croutons” per person the chicken and croutons can be served hot cold or at room temperature i like the contrast of the warm croutons and chicken with the crisp cold greens but it’s great with cold chicken too sabrina modelle how to time the cooking make sure your grill is hot before beginning to grill even a high-btu gas grill needs at least 10 to 15 minutes to build up heat if you have a thermometer on your grill make sure it reads at least 500of i like to grill the bread first and then the chicken that way i can watch each of them and also to make sure there is no cross contamination between the raw chicken and the lightly grilled bread the bread only takes a couple of minutes and the chicken takes about 8 to 10 minutes depending on the size of the thighs more summer salads blt salad with buttermilk dressing
